        Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures
        and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
        together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python web site,
        https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed.
        The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.
      </p>

        <p>
          The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++
          (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system.
          It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained,
          so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.

    <header>Comparing Python to Other Languages</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        Python is often compared to other interpreted languages such as Java, JavaScript, Perl, Tcl,
        or Smalltalk. Comparisons to C++, Common Lisp and Scheme can also be enlightening. In this section I will briefly
        compare Python to each of these languages. These comparisons concentrate on language issues only. In practice,
        the choice of a programming language is often dictated by other real-world constraints such as cost, availability, training, and prior investment,
        or even emotional attachment. Since these aspects are highly variable, it seems a waste of time to consider them much for this comparison.

        <br>
        Python programs are generally expected to run slower than Java programs,
        but they also take much less time to develop. Python programs are typically 3-5 times
        shorter than equivalent Java programs. This difference can be attributed to Python's built-in
         high-level data types and its dynamic typing. For example, a Python programmer wastes no time
         declaring the types of arguments or variables, and Python's powerful polymorphic list and dictionary
         types, for which rich syntactic support is built straight into the language, find a use in almost every
         Python program. Because of the run-time typing, Python's run time must work harder than Java's. For example,
         when evaluating the expression a+b, it must first inspect the objects a and b to find out their type, which
         is not known at compile time. It then invokes the appropriate addition operation, which may be an overloaded
          user-defined method. Java, on the other hand, can perform an efficient integer
         or floating point addition, but requires variable declarations for a and b, and does not allow
          overloading of the + operator for instances of user-defined classes.

      <li>
        <spam><b>Javascript</b></spam>
        <br>
        Python's "object-based" subset is roughly equivalent to JavaScript.
         Like JavaScript (and unlike Java), Python supports a programming style that uses simple functions
         and variables without engaging in class definitions. However, for JavaScript, that's all there is.
         Python, on the other hand,
        supports writing much larger programs and better code reuse through a true object-oriented programming style,
         where classes and inheritance play an important role.
      </li>

      <li>
        <spam><b>C++</b></spam>
        <br>
        Almost everything said for Java also applies for C++, just more so: where Python code
        is typically 3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java code, it is often 5-10 times shorter than equivalent
        C++ code! Anecdotal evidence suggests that one Python programmer
         can finish in two months what two C++ programmers can't complete in a year. Python shines
          as a glue language, used to combine components written in C++.

    <header>Installing</header>
    <article>
      <p>Installing Python is generally easy, and nowadays many Linux and UNIX distribution
      s include a recent Python. Even some Windows computers (notably those from HP) now come with Python
      already installed. </p>

      <p>If you do need to install
      Python and aren't confident about the task you can find a few notes on the BeginnersGuide/Download
      wiki page, but installation is unremarkable on most platforms.</p>

    <header>Python Indentation</header>
    <article>
        <p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.</p>

      <p>Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.</p>

      <p>Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>

      <code>if 5 > 2:
      <spam class="tab1" style="padding-left: 2em;">print("Five is greater than two!")</spam></code>

        Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

      <code>if 5 > 2:
        if 5 > 2:
      print("Five is greater than two!")</code>


      The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one.

      <code>if 5 > 2:
      <spam class="tab1" style="padding-left: 1em;">print("Five is greater than two!")</spam>
      if 5 > 2:
      <spam class="tab1" style="padding-left: 4em;">print("Five is greater than two!")</spam></code>


      You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:
        <code>if 5 > 2:
      print("Five is greater than two!")
        <spam class="tab1" style="padding-left: 4em;">print("Five is greater than two!")</spam></code>

        Variables in Python:

        <code>x = 5
        y = "Hello, World!"</code>

        Python has no command for declaring a variable.
